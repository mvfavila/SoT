# SumOfThis

Small travel startup. I have used this opportunity to learn more about what goes in to a 'bootstrapped' startup, to develop my skills and assist in the success of SumOfThis. This project includes the following technologies: 

- Microsoft C# .NET 4.7 (SOLID principles) 
- MVC 5 front-end 
- HTML 5, JavaScript, CSS3, Angular 4 
- Rest Services 
- Git, Entity Framework 6, Dapper, Simple Injector, xUnit, Moq, Bogus, AxoCover 

Some of the patterns being used are MVC architecture, DTO, Immutable Objects, Repository, CQRS, Factory Method, Singleton, Unit of Work and others, along with some aspects of Domain Driven Design.
